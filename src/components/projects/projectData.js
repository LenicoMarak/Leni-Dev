		communication platform â€” much like WhatsApp, but simpler and open for future improvements.

		Users can register and log in using their email credentials via Firebase Authentication. Once logged in, they can view a list of active users, start one-to-one chats, and receive real-time updates.
		Firebase Realtime Database ensures instant message delivery and sync across devices. The app also features a modern, minimal UI inspired by Material Design guidelines, ensuring ease of use even
		for non-technical users.

		Throughout the project, I focused on both backend logic and UI consistency. This project helped me understand key mobile development concepts like activity lifecycle, asynchronous operations,
		Firebase integration, and real-time data syncing.

			One of the core strenght of this calculator lies in its advanced exprrssion evaluation.I've implement a system that can handle complex medium mathematical expressions,not just simple binary operation.
			This is achieve through the use of infix to postfix conversion,a fundamental algorithm in compiler design and expression parsing.By converting user-entered infix expression(the way humans typically write them)
			into postfix notation,the app can then efficiently and accurately evalute them,ensuring correct order of operations and handling of parentheses.

			The user interface .crafted with Jetpack Compose,provides a fluid and rsponsive experience.Compose's declarative UI paradigm allowed me to build dynamic and visually appealing layout wit ease, ensuring
			the app looks great and function seamlessly acros different Android devices.
